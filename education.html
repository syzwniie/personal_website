        <p class="center-text">This was my very first kindergarten, located near my house. I still remember crying a lot on my first days because I hated going to school, but over time I adjusted and started to enjoy it. This was where I began to learn basic reading, writing, and social skills.</p>

        <p class="center-text">My primary school years were filled with cherished memories. This school, also close to home, gave me many opportunities to grow. I actively joined sports, bicara berirama, and various co-curricular activities. I made many close friends here and learned how much I enjoyed being part of school events.</p>

        <p class="center-text">Moving to a new country, I experienced international school for the first time. It was a girls-only school, and I really liked the neat and formal school uniform. I also experienced taking the school van for the first time, which was new and exciting for me.</p>

        <img src="images/jubail.webp" width="350px" height="250px" alt="Al-Hussan School">
        <p class="center-text">This was a larger international school with a welcoming and supportive environment. It was quite far from home, so I had to take the school bus for the first time. The bus driver didn’t speak much English, which made communication a bit challenging at first, but he was always kind and helpful. During my time there, I joined the basketball and badminton teams and was honored to receive the Student of the Month award.</p>

        <p class="center-text">I returned to Malaysia to prepare for my PT3 examination and joined this school. Although the transition back to the local education system was a challenge, I was able to adapt quickly and continued to focus on my studies.</p>
